# Diversity and specificity of molecular functions in cyanobacterial symbionts

## Abstract
Cyanobacteria are globally occurring photosynthetic bacteria notable for their contribution to primary production and production of toxins which have detrimental ecosystem impacts. Furthermore, cyanobacteria can form mutualistic symbiotic relationships with a diverse set of eukaryotes, including land plants, aquatic plankton and fungi. Nevertheless, not all cyanobacteria are found in symbiotic associations suggesting symbiotic cyanobacteria have evolved specializations that facilitate host-interactions. Photosynthetic capabilities, nitrogen fixation, and the production of complex biochemicals are key functions provided by host-associated cyanobacterial symbionts. To explore if additional specializations are associated with such lifestyles in cyanobacteria, we have conducted comparative phylogenomics of molecular functions and of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in 984 cyanobacterial genomes. Cyanobacteria with host-associated and symbiotic lifestyles were concentrated in the family Nostocaceae, where eight monophyletic clades correspond to specific host taxa. In agreement with previous studies, symbionts are likely to provide fixed nitrogen to their eukaryotic partners, through multiple different nitrogen fixation pathways. Additionally, our analyses identified chitin metabolising pathways in cyanobacteria associated with specific host groups, while obligate symbionts had fewer BGCs. The conserved molecular functions and BGCs between closely related symbiotic and free-living cyanobacteria suggests the potential for additional cyanobacteria to form symbiotic relationships than is currently known.
